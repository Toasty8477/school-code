# CSC1120 Lab 6

This is the first of a multipart lab where you will implement a program using various data structures, write tests that will verify all the various structures, and compare the performance of the different implementations.
Each lab will build on your previous work and you will ultimately run an experiment on the various implementations to determine the most appropriate structure for the different tasks required.

    - Determine test method(s) and implement them for `size()`
* [ ] Commit 7 "Lab completed"
    - Implement tests and `UnorderedList` implementations of the remaining methods in the `AutoCompleter` interface
    - Add a block comment at the end of the `AutoCompleterTest` class discussing
      the following: "What method did you find most difficult to test? Why?"
