# Week 12 Exercise
You have been provided implementations of four search algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, and Merge Sort along with a driver that will sort an array using all four algorithms.

### Manually Calculate the Number of Element Accesses
For each algorithm, run the driver class to calculate how many times the algorithm will access each element if sorting the array below. An access is considered to be either a comparison with another element or a swap with another element. If both occur, only count one access. You will change the arrays being sorted after each run and record your observations in an Excel spreadsheet.

### Benchmark
Run SortingBenchmarker on the following arrays:

<ul>
  <li>{40, 35, 80, 75, 60, 90, 70, 65, 50, 22}</li>
  <li>500 random values</li>
  <li>1,000 random values</li>
  <li>5,000 random values</li>
  <li>10,000 random values</li>
  <li>50,000 random values (omit Selection Sort)</li>
  <li>100,000 random values (omit Selection Sort and Insertion Sort)</li>
  <li>200,000 random values (omit Selection Sort and Insertion Sort)</li>
  <li>500,000 random values (omit Selection Sort and Insertion Sort)</li>
</ul>

Plot these results in an Excel spreadsheet in a line chart and upload a screenshot of your results into Canvas.
