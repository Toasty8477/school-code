# Space Complexity Exercise


1.  Start running this program, but do not press enter
2.  Launch `jconsole` from the command prompt (not the terminal inside IntelliJ).
   a. If the `jconsole` command does not work, navigate to your Java folder, into your JDK, then into the `bin` folder. Find `jconsole`, right-click and run it
4.  In `jconsole`, select the `SpaceComplexityDriver` process from the list and  click _**Connect**_
5.  Click _**Insecure Connection**_
6.  Once it is running, you will see several windows with measurements
7.  Note the Heap Memory Usage.
8.  Press enter and let each sort algorithm run.
9.  Note the Heap Memory Usage after each algorithm has run
10.  Also note the CPU usage
11. Be aware that the heap usage will rise as the program idles, so wait
    for the sort to finish, give the console a moment to catch up, then
    run the next sort
12. Do this for sizes of 100,000 for all four sorting algorithms, then 500,000 and 1,000,000 for just Shell Sort and Merge Sort
